        <p>The purpose of this platform is for carpenters and other professionals to be able to purchase windows and doors online and be able to get a price quote instantly, instead of waiting up to multiple days the “old fashioned” way.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my work on this project I have conducted a great deal of user interviews with the different types of users, to uncover user pains regarding the old design and how we could address these and other possible user needs for the new and improved layout.

            Consistency is king

        <p>
            Since this is such a complex tool with many features, its important that all the different visual elements are easy and quick to interpret, and all the similar functions are consistent in appearance. As an example, every different kind of button in the system that creates something new, has the exact same green gradient, which also makes the buttons stand out from the rest of the elements.

            Design systems
        </h2>
        <p>
            Buying windows is no simple task, since the configuration possibilities are practically endless and the needs of each individual carpenter varies greatly. This combined with the platform having many different other features to accommodate user needs, makes up for a very complex system with a lot of components. That’s why one of my main focus points in designing this has been creating and maintaining a functional design system. Especially in this case, since this platform is being used by two different companies with different visual identities.
        </p>
        <p>
            To me, one of the most important aspects of design is being able to get thoughts out of your head and down into psychical form. This is why I developed a comprehensive library of components, so that visualising a new idea for a function or flow would be as easy as possible.
