        <p>In this project, I was hired in to do UX design for an app that Snapp were planning to create with an external client. The idea behind the app is to act as a social platform that cyclist can create and find cycling events that are tailored to their exact preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked closely with their developers and their client to ensure that the design would meet both the cliens demands and the technologies that would lie behind.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final product onboards the user with their unique cycling preferences, and utilizes design patterns from the iOS calendar app for them to select when they want to participate in events.
